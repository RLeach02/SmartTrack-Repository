# SmartTrack Inventory Management Application

Due to extensive issues in finalising the Node.js structure, our website was converted to function off of Blade PHP. This is due to prior experience with the structure for Ryan and enables easier application development due to extisting knowledge and code structure from previous application development in Web Development and Security ZEIT3119.

The use of Chat GPT was used for troubleshooting and code-related problem solving across both iterations of the site.

The previous Node.js implementation can be viewed in the Reset Branch of the repository.
